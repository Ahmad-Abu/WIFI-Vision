abstract = {We present RF-Capture, a system that captures the human figure -- i.e., a coarse skeleton -- through a wall. RF-Capture tracks the 3D positions of a person's limbs and body parts even when the person is fully occluded from its sensor, and does so without placing any markers on the subject's body. In designing RF-Capture, we built on recent advances in wireless research, which have shown that certain radio frequency (RF) signals can traverse walls and reflect off the human body, allowing for the detection of human motion through walls. In contrast to these past systems which abstract the entire human body as a single point and find the overall location of that point through walls, we show how we can reconstruct various human body parts and stitch them together to capture the human figure. We built a prototype of RF-Capture and tested it on 15 subjects. Our results show that the system can capture a representative human figure through walls and use it to distinguish between various users.},

abstract = {Decimeter-level localization has become a reality, in part due to the ability to eliminate the effects of multipath interference. In this paper, we demonstrate the ability to use multipath reflections to enhance localization rather than throwing them away. We present Multipath Triangulation, a new localization technique that uses multipath reflections to localize a target device with a single receiver that does not require any form of coordination with any other devices. In this paper, we leverage multipath triangulation to build the first decimeter-level WiFi localization system, called MonoLoco, that requires only a single access point (AP) and a single channel, and does not impose any overhead, data sharing, or coordination protocols beyond standard WiFi communication. As a bonus, it also determines the orientation of the target relative to the AP. We implemented MonoLoco using Intel 5300 commodity WiFi cards and deploy it in four environments with different multipath propagation. Results indicate median localization error of 0.5m and median orientation error of 6.6 degrees, which are comparable to the best performing prior systems, all of which require multiple APs and/or multiple frequency channels. High accuracy can be achieved with only a handful of packets.},

ABSTRACT = {Ultra-wideband radio signals are used in communication, indoor localization and radar systems, due to the high data rates, the high resilience to fading and the fine temporal resolution that can be achieved with a large bandwidth. This paper introduces a new method to estimate the angle of arrival of ultra-wideband radio signals with which existing time-of-flight based localization and radar systems can be augmented at no additional hardware cost. The method does not require multiple transmitter or receiver antennas, or relative motion between transmitter and receiver. Instead, it is solely based on the angle-dependent impulse response function of ultra-wideband antennas. Datasets on which the method is evaluated are publicly available. The method is further applied to a localization problem and it is shown how a robot can self-localize solely based on these angle of arrival estimates, and how they can be combined with time-of-flight measurements. Even though existing angle of arrival techniques that use multiple antennas show better accuracy, the method presented herein looks promising enough to be developed further and could potentially lead to electronically and mechanically simpler angle of arrival estimation technology.},

abstract = {This paper explores the viability of precise indoor localization using physical layer information in WiFi systems. We find evidence that channel responses from multiple OFDM subcarriers can be a promising location signature. While these signatures certainly vary over time and environmental mobility, we notice that their core structure preserves certain properties that are amenable to localization. We attempt to harness these opportunities through a functional system called PinLoc, implemented on off-the-shelf Intel 5300 cards. We evaluate the system in a busy engineering building, a crowded student center, a cafeteria, and at the Duke University museum, and demonstrate localization accuracies in the granularity of 1m x 1m boxes, called "spots". Results from 100 spots show that PinLoc is able to localize users to the correct spot with 89% mean accuracy, while incurring less than 6% false positives. We believe this is an important step forward, compared to the best indoor localization schemes of today, such as Horus.},
